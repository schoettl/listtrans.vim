This plugin toggles a sentence separated by , or ; to a list.


## Toggle lists

Example configuration:

    nmap  ;l   <Plug>ListtransToggle
    vmap  ;l   <Plug>ListtransToggleVisual

If you have `,` in the list and toggle back to a sentence then it will be
separated by `;`.

Toggling from a list to a sentence, it will add `and` at the end of list item.


This doesn't work if you are swapping : and ;. Get rid of that.
If you have , in the list and toggle back to a sentence then it will be 
separated by ;.

Toggling from a list to a sentence, it will add 'and' at the end of list item.


## Conjunctions

The default conjuction is 'and'. If you use other conjuctions which listed below, it will be added in the list 
before the last item.

    Default conjunction: and
    Conjunctions: and not, and, plus, with, or else, or otherwise, or, nor, but not, but, else, otherwise
